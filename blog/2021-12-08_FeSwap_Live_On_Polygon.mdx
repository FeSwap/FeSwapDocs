As Ethereum network is more and more expensive, FeSwap cold-start on Ethereum is quite difficult and seems impossible at this 
phase, so it is time to deploy FeSwap to some other cheaper and EVM-compliant blockchains.

At first, Binance Smart Chain is our selection. But we finally decide to deploy on Polygon 
considering that Polygon is the most cost effective Ethereum scaling solution conveying plenty of Defi applications 
and ecosystem. 
 
Compared to the smart contract implementation on Ethereum, we have done quite some code optimization to be more 
gas fee effective, and a new designed patch mechanism is added to a few core smart contracts as the security escape 
hatch in case. These smart contracts have been exhaustively tested, and now is ready to be officially launched.

Similar as FeSwap on Ethereum, each token pair is minted as an NFT, but all the NFTs on Polygon network is auctioned 
with starting price of ZERO. The owner of each token pair NFT will share 60% of the protocol profits earned by 
the corresponding liquidity pool.

Commission free seems crazy for decentralized exchange. FeSwap invites everyone to try and to prove that 
it works, and it works well, it works even better than charging end users.

FeSwap will launched on Polygon at 2021-12-12 12:00:00 (UTC+8). Why not pick up some free token pair NFTs for yourself?
