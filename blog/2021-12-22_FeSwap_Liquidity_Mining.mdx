Underpined by Polygon's highly cost-effective performance, FeSwap, the world's first and only DEX charging 
no commission fee to, is quickly and broadly adopted on Polygon network.

Nealy 500 token pair NFTs are minted, and about 1.4 million FESW@M tokens are airdropped within last two weeks. And more than 200
exchange transactions have completed to display out how the exchange transactions could be free, and how the liquidity
provider's profit are earned by capturing profit from the price slipppage caused by crypto market variability.

To grow and give back to the community, we have launched liquidity mining on 5 liquidity pools, 
which are: MATIC/USDC, MATIC/ETH, MATIC/USDT, ETH/USDC, MATIC/FESW@M.

10 millon FESW are available to mine within 120 days for each one of the 5 liquidity pools. Following minable liquidity pools 
could be proposed and voted by the community.
