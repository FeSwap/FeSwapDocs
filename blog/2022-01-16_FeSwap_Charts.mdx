Based on `The Graph` protocol and the [FeSwap subgraph](https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/feswap/free-swap), 
FeSwap Charts is available for end-users to explore the `Token`, `Pair`, and the `Account` information on FeSwap Exchange.

As FeSwap is commission-fee, the exchange profit is calculated according to the K-Value square root increase within the
internal token exchange taken place while the token price deviation between the twin token pair reaches the threshold,
instead of calculating from the exchange volume.

From the information shown on the charts, it is clear that even if FeSwap does not charge any fees to exchange users, 
the liquidity providers can still make competitive profits from the swap transactions.
