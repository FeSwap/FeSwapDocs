  <h1> FeSwap Governance on Fantom </h1>
</div>

_______________________

FeSwap has been deployed on Ethereum mainnet, but not been widely adopted for the sake of high gas fees and low available liquidities. So FeSwap DAO decides to deploy its commission-free DEX Dapp on Fantom considering the lower transaction cost and higher transaction performance.

- <p><b>FESW@F</b> will be minted to be used as the governance token on Fantom. FESW@F has no correlation with FESW-like tokens on other Ethereum-compliant network, and just can be used as the governance token on Fantom.</p>

- Total supply of FESW@F token is <b>1 billion</b>, all are minted at the momemt of deployment, and cannot be minted any more.
