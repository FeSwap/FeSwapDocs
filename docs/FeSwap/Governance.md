### <span className="title"> Community governance </span>

Current governance voting statistics of UniSwap and etc. showed that the voting turnout is some low. The main reasons are estimated to be:

1. Users need to pay a certain voting cost to participate in community governance voting;
2. Most community proposals have no direct interest with users;
3. Users can still vote with their feet even if they don't participate in voting.

To attract community members to actively participate in voting for governance proposals and become more involved in community events, FeSwap will distribute 2% of FESW to all the voting participants every year. 

To attract more liquidity providers, FeSwap will distribute 15% of the total amount of FESW tokens in a ratio of 9%, 4%, and 2% over 3 years with the yield farming mechanism.

To attract more exchange users, FeSwap will also distribute 15% of the total amount of FESW tokens in a ratio of 9%, 4%, and 2% over 3 years. The distribution rule will comprehensively consider the exchange frequency, exchange amount, and the relationship to trigger internal swap pair arbitrage.
