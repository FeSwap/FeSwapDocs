_______________________

FeSwap DAO does not own and control any crypto asset liquidity pools, the NFT owner of the liquidity pool does. NFT owner earns 60% of the
protocol profit of the belonged liquidity pools, FeSwap DAO just collect the left 40%. NFT owner also has the privilege to set the price gap
trigerring internal asset exchange, to config the fraction of protocol profit in the total exchange profit, and to swith on/off the price
oracle utility. 

To be an NFT owner of an asset-pair liquidity pool is extremly easy, just create it with **ZERO** bidding price. You need to pay nothing
else than some miminal transaction gas fees on Harmony. If the NFT is created or occupied by someone else, you could bid it with a litte bit
higher price, which is 2% more than current price, or just 10 ONE adding price if current price is less than 500 ONE. Once there is no one else
bidding this NFT within the bidding duration which is 3 days starting from it is first bidded, you will be the winner of this NFT.

Each time you bid for an NFT, you will get some giveaway in FESW@O. As the fisrt bidder of an NFT, you will get 5000 FESW@O. While bidding
with a higher price, you will get the giveaway at the rate of 20 FESW@O/ONE based on your bidding price increment, no matter whether
you are the first bidder or following bidder.

As the winner of an NFT bidding, you will get the giveaway at the rate of 100 FESW@O/ONE based on your final bidding price, which is
distributed alongside with the creation of the liquidity pool while you claim your won NFT.
