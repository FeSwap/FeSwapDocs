FESW is the governance token of FeSwap community. With FESW token, you are able to submit FeSwap governance proposals and vote on all these proposals. <br/> 

By depositing your liquidity tokens, you are able to harvest some amount of FESW token, which is propotional to your liquidity token amount and depositing duration. <br/> 

ETHüîóWBTC, ETHüîóUSDT, ETHüîóFESW are the 3 token pair pools available to mining FESW in this phase. Later on new pools could be activated based on community proposals.
