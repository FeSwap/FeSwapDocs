FeSwap, as a decentralized exchange, supports ERC20 token exchange completely with no exchange fee.

But FeSwap can still make competitive profits for its liquidity providers thanks to a creative internal arbitrage mechanism, which both reduces some security attack risk, and aslo works well as a new economic modal to drive the decentralized exchange.

Within FeSwap application, each swap pair has its owner, who is the bidding winner of this token pair NFT. Only the owner of the NFT is able to creat the respective token swap pair, so token pair creation is some constrained. In this way, the token pair quality could be guaranted in some level.

Swapping token within FeSwap is simple and easy. Enjoy surfing of Defi ! <br/>
