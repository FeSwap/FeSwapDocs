Similar as Binance Smart Chain, Ploygon is also EVM-compliant, and gas fee effective in handling transactions. So FeSwap DAO has decided to deploy its commission-free DEX Dapp on Ploygon as well.

- <p><b>FESW@M</b> will be minted to be used as the governance token on Ploygon. FESW@M has no correlation with FESW on Ethereum, and FESW@B on BSC, which can just be used as the governance token on Ploygon.</p>

- Total supply of FESW@M token is <b>1 billion</b>, all are minted at the momemt of deployment, and cannot be minted any more.
