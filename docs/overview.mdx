  <h1> FeSwap Overview </h1>
</div>

FeSwap Exchange is the world's first free decentralized cryptocurrency exchange. 

FeSwap sets up two one-way swap sub-pools for each pair of ERC20 tokens, and conducts internal token swap at the preset threshold of the price deviation. This internal token swap can smooth the prive divergence, and also make profits for liquidity prodivers.

FESW is the token representing FeSwap governance rights.

FeSwap NFT represents the ownership of the specific swap pair, and the right sharing the exchange revenue.
