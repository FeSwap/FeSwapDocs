## <span className="title"> Manage FeSwap NFT </span>

As the NFT owner you can config the arbitrage rate of your token pair. Normally the higher the arbitrage rate, the more the profit making by the token pair. But higher arbitrage rate means higher token price deviation, which could prevent users from using the token pair. 1.0-1.5% is the preferred arbitrage rate. If you are not sure how to set and/or how much to set the arbitrage rate, just keep it as the default, which is 1.0%. <br/>

As the NFT owner you can set the swapping profit receiver, normally it is yourself by deafult, but it could be any address you want to specify.
